            So, how do you recruit the best candidate?
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">To ensure you end up with the best hire, the trick is to have a laid out plan for every opening. Here is a 5-step guide towards recruiting the best candidate in any vacancy&nbsp;at your organization.</span></p>
            <h4><span style="color: #7a4d1c;"><strong>
                1. Craft a winning job description</strong></span></h4><p><span style="color: #000000;">
            When faced with the need to hire a new employee, you may be quick to come up with a job description fast, don't. A hasty description is the first step towards recruiting the wrong person.<p></p>Take time to think through the position in question; what skills do you want the job holder to have? What educational qualifications fit the position? <p>How about their personality – is an extroverted person the better fit or would you rather an introvert? What about the experience – is the industry background relevant? <p>Answering these questions will help you come up with the ideal description that will help wade off unqualified candidates, leaving you with a specific talent pool.</span></p><h4><span style="color: #7a4d1c;"><strong>
           
            2. Come up with a job advertisement and post on the right platform</strong></span></h4><p><span style="color: #000000;">After creating your winning description, the next step is creating the actual advert and choosing the platform to post on. Now, if you are working with a recruitment firm, you need not worry much about this step as the recruiters will do it for you. <p>But if you are recruiting in-house, as an employer you must be very particular on what you include in the ad and where you post it; the two will determine the type of applicants you get.<p>While posting on various platforms may attract more applicants in less time, it will probably give you the wrong talent pool. <p>The platform you choose should depend on the type of position you are trying to fill. On the other hand, a good advert should include a summary of your company and position in question, key skills and competencies required, qualifications in terms of both education and experience and information on how to apply. <p>This gives you a guide to eliminate those not qualified.</span></p><h3><span style="color: #7a4d1c;"><strong>
            
            3. Create a ‘cheat sheet’ for your ideal employee</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: #000000;">Once you have your ad up and running, the next step is to come up with a profile for the ideal employee, or what we call a recruitment ‘cheat sheet’. <p>From your current employees, chances are you already know who performs best, who the average one is and who has their clock ticking. <p>Since your aim is to recruit the best candidate, focusing on the skills, character and motivation of your best performing employees will help you narrow down the best applicants. <p>Think about it; if your best performing employees are happy, then recruiting new personnel with similar skills can guarantee you similar performance. <p>Based on what keeps your best employees motivated, create a cheat sheet of the ideal employee for the position. Use the <span style="color: #7a4d1c;"><a style="color: #7a4d1c;" href="wait a minute sir">cheat sheet</a></span> to sort out through the applications.<p> This will help you select candidates who will easily blend into your company culture.</span></p><h3><span style="color: #7a4d1c;"><strong>
           
            4. Use a proven assessment tool in the recruiting process</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: #000000;">The <span style="color: #7a4d1c;"><a style="color: #7a4d1c;" href="https://www.corporatestaffing.co.ke/cc/cv-writing-service-kenya/">CV and Cover letter </a></span>are not usually enough to tell who the best candidate for the position is and that is why we have </span>job interviews <span style="color: #000000;">and psychometric tests. In an interview, you are able to interact with candidates&nbsp;and pick out the better communicator, the self-driven, the confident and even the fake.<p> But even a well-crafted set of interview questions and an intimidating interview panel may not differentiate between the best candidate and one who excels at job interviews because they prepared well. </span>
